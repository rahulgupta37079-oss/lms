# 🔑 How to Get Your Zoom Credentials

## Current Situation

You provided:
- **Account ID**: `KCiJH1NATLqbdWhryA3ujQ` ✅
- **Client ID**: `nUZuo4LR7O5khLR_he49A` ✅

## 📋 Step-by-Step: Get Correct Credentials

### Step 1: Go to Zoom App Marketplace

1. **Open browser** and go to:
   ```
   https://marketplace.zoom.us/user/build
   ```

2. **Sign in** with your Zoom account

3. You should see a list of your apps

---

### Step 2: Find Your App

Look for an app with:
- **Account ID**: `KCiJH1NATLqbdWhryA3ujQ`
- **Type**: Should say "Server-to-Server OAuth"

**Click on the app** to open its settings.

---

### Step 3: Get App Credentials

Once you're in the app settings:

1. **Look for the "App Credentials" section**
   
   You'll see three fields:

   ```
   Account ID: KCiJH1NATLqbdWhryA3ujQ
   Client ID: nUZuo4LR7O5khLR_he49A
   Client Secret: [Hidden] ●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●● [Copy]
   ```

2. **Click "Copy" button** next to Client Secret
   
   ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This is the permanent credential we need!

3. **Paste it somewhere temporarily** (like a text editor)

---

### Step 4: Verify the Client Secret

The **Client Secret** should:
- Be **32-64 characters** long
- Contain **letters, numbers, and special characters**
- Look something like: `abcDEF123456_xyz789-ABCDEF`
- **NOT** be the same as what you provided: `sxnovrKiRA6aAPQG_csmSw`

---

### Step 5: Check if App is Activated

**VERY IMPORTANT**: The app must be activated!

1. In the app settings, click the **"Activation"** tab
2. You should see: **"Activate your app"** toggle
3. Make sure it's **ON** (blue/green color)
4. Status should show: ✅ **"Activated"**

If it's not activated:
- Toggle it **ON**
- Click **"Done"** or **"Save"**

---

### Step 6: Verify Scopes

Click the **"Scopes"** tab and make sure these are checked:

- ✅ `meeting:write:admin` - Create meetings
- ✅ `meeting:read:admin` - Read meetings
- ✅ `meeting:update:admin` - Update meetings
- ✅ `meeting:delete:admin` - Delete meetings
- ✅ `recording:read:admin` - View recordings

If any are missing:
- Click **"+ Add Scopes"**
- Search for each scope
- Check the box
- Click **"Done"**

## 🎯 What to Share With Me

Once you have the credentials, share them in this format:

```
Account ID: KCiJH1NATLqbdWhryA3ujQ
Client ID: nUZuo4LR7O5khLR_he49A
Client Secret: [paste the FULL secret here - should be 32-64 characters]
```

## 🤔 Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Copying Access Token Instead of Client Secret
- **Access Token**: Temporary (expires in 1 hour)
  - Looks like: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...` (very long, 100+ chars)
  - Generated by the API
- **Client Secret**: Permanent
  - Looks like: `abc123XYZ_def456...` (32-64 chars)
  - Found in app settings

### ❌ Mistake 2: App Not Activated
- Even with correct credentials, if app isn't activated, it won't work
- **Solution**: Toggle "Activate your app" to ON

### ❌ Mistake 3: Wrong App Type
- Must be **"Server-to-Server OAuth"**
- NOT "JWT" or "OAuth 2.0"
- **Solution**: Create a new Server-to-Server OAuth app

### ❌ Mistake 4: Copying Wrong App's Credentials
- If you have multiple apps, make sure you're copying from the right one
- **Solution**: Verify Account ID matches: `KCiJH1NATLqbdWhryA3ujQ`

## 🆘 Alternative: Create New App

### Create New Server-to-Server OAuth App:

4. **Copy credentials** from the next screen:

   - `meeting:write:admin`
   - `meeting:read:admin`
   - `meeting:update:admin`
   - `meeting:delete:admin`
   - `recording:read:admin`

6. **Activate** (Activation tab):
